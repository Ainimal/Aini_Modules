# ω👁м👁 modules
A modular PyTorch-based neural network library, just for building networks flexibly ~

A net work can be split into few modules, such like
 - vgg = encoder + cls head
 - Unet
 - resnet
 - densenet
 - deeplabv3


# Main modules
 - resblock？
 - dense block
 - decoder block
 - transformer block


# Example
```python
import wama_modules as wmds

```
